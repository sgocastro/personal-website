            <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
            <p>
              I started in the world of web development in 2018 and I was using
              C#, .NET Framework, JavaScript Vanilla and a lot of jQuery and I
              permormed like a
              <strong>back end developer mainly</strong> but I also touched
              front end.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since 2019 I know the React.js library and I
              <strong>loved there so much</strong>. When I discovered this
              library know which I wanted to be a front end developer and focus
              in all the technologies of this ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
              In all teams that I worked/work, I always push for try to use new
              technologies and take the better practises in the developments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Between my achivements and developments, I worked in productive
              applications with React.js, React Native, Node.js and .NET (Core /
              Framework) and currently I want start create content for try to
              help all the people that they want to init in this beautiful
              world.
